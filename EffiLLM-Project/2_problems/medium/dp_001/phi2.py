This code is the correct solution to the problem. It takes two lists of integers as input and returns the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both lists. It uses nested loops to compare each element in one list with every element in the other list, and if they match, it increases the `k` counter by 1 until it finds an element that is different. The maximum length of such repeated subarrays is then found using the `max` function.
